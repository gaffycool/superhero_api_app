# superhero_api_app
superhero api app in kotlin and mvvm, using dagger, and db caching for offline

the idea of the app is to use the superhero api and whilst refreshing, it would send the year to the api call and then return a list of superheros
for that particular year

i also implemented dagger, clean archetecture, and offline caching using a local db
